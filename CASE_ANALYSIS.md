# Task 1
First, we calculated the precision and recall for both models at confidence threshold 0.5 and IOU threshold 0.4.

| Model | Precision | Recall |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1     | 0.9212    | 0.3025 |
| 2     | 0.9441    | 0.4135 |

For both precision and recall, model 2 appears to do a better job.

# Task 2
We can use stratified sampling to ensure that the model accounts for all classes equally.
